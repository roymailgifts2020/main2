It’s almost like deja vu all over again. </p> <p> The Xbox Series S still clocks in at the lowest price-point at just $299, but it’s a less powerful system than the others by a pretty wide margin.</p> <p> The PS5 will release just two days after its rival next-gen system, hitting shelves on November 12th. There’s still no word on pre-orders, but it may be a very difficult console to find at launch due to high demand and reported production bottlenecks due to the ongoing global pandemic.</p> <p> The consoles are all launching just days after the US presidential election, amidst what will almost certainly be one of the most contentious elections in US history. It will be an interesting time, make no mistake. Perhaps not an ideal time to launch a new console, though many of us will be happy for the distraction.</p> <p> The rest of the showcase was fine. We saw some gameplay from games like Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Deathloop, Resident Evil Village and the Demon’s Souls remake. But both Sony and Microsoft have a long ways to go to convince consumers that these are essential purchases right now.</p> MORE FOR YOU <h3> Restock: Here’s Your Next Big Chance To Buy A PS5 Or Xbox Series X+S</h3> <h3> Xbox Series X Has Made A Better First Impression Than PS5 So Far</h3> <h3> A ‘Destiny 2’ Double Exotic Necrotic Thorn Build Is So Good It’s Probably Gone Soon</h3> <p> (Note: I’ve been guessing the $499/$399 price point for some time now.
