It has scored well with DVD playback, Blu-rays and 4K streaming over the years. So what will the PlayStation 5 have to offer at launch? Will it be an 8K machine? Will it still support optical media? When is the PS5 release date? How much will the PS5 cost and when will PS5 pre-orders be open to all?</p> <span> <span> </span> <span> <span> &#169; Provided by TechRadar</span> PS5: release date, specs and news for the PlayStation 5 </span> </span> <p> We've been reporting all of the PS5 news and rumours but we now have all the concrete PS5 information. Sony's recent PS5 Showcase filled in the last few gaps in our knowledge, including price, release date and how to pre-order . Sony has even invited a select few to go 'hands on' with the hotly-anticipated hardware...</p> <strong> PS5 release date:</strong> 12th November in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea; 19th November in the UK and rest of the world <strong> PS5 price:</strong> the PS5 Digital Edition price is £360 (€400, $400, AU$599) and the full-fat PS5 with disc drive will cost £450 (€500, $500, AU$750) <p> The PS5 console itself has now been revealed . In fact, make that consoles , because there are actually two versions of the PS5 on the way: one with an optical disc drive and a 'Digital Edition' that does without – and both will feature a dashboard that's had a "100 per cent overhaul" from the user interface on the PS4. </p> <p> Load Error</p> <p> Like the already-revealed 'DualSense' controller , the PS5 consoles are exceptionally stylish. In fact, we'd argue that this could be the most strikingly sculpted games machine ever created. For once, the myriad fanboy-created concepts were too conservative.</p> <p> We've also seen new accessories, including the Pulse 3D wireless headset , a DualSense Charging Station in which you can dock two controllers at once, and an HD Camera that mimics the look of the console itself. Sony has also taken the time to add a ' Ready for PlayStation 5 ' logo to its high frame rate-supporting Bravia TVs.</p> <p> We also now know plenty about the PS5 games line-up, too. There's Final Fantasy 16 , Hogwarts Legacy , a new God of War game, an expanded and enhanced version of GTA 5 (yes, really), to yet another entry in the Resident Evil franchise, the hotly anticipated Horizon II . It's also been reported that the original Metal Gear Solid is being remade exclusively for the PS5.</p> <p> We've been waiting a long time to get to this point. PlayStation’s lead architect and console producer, Mark Cerny, got the PS5 info-ball rolling back in an April 2019 interview and has since, alongside Sony CEO Jim Ryan, expanded on what we can expect from the games console.</p> <p> The March 2020 tech-heavy Road to PS5 presentation gave us a "deep dive" on the PlayStation 5's architecture, focusing heavily on the inclusion of SSD storage and cast some doubt over whether or not the PS5 will be supporting Dolby Atmos. More on that below.</p> <p> Sony officially confirmed some details, including the official name and rough release date, back in October 2019, and, at CES 2020, Sony confirmed the official PS5 logo . We also know that the PS5 DualShock 5 controller will be called the DualSense controller.</p> <p> So, where do we stand now, after the latest PS5 event? Read on and absorb all of the PlayStation 5 details currently available, and start saving for your next console.</p> <p> Looking for a new TV to make the most out of your inevitable console purchase next year? Then look no further, for we've found the best TV deals live right now! </p> <p> <strong> With weeks to go before the PS5 arrives, there's plenty of time to make use of a new PS4. You can find plenty of excellent </strong> <strong> PS4 deals</strong> <strong> in both the UK and US.</strong> </p> <h2> PS5 pre-order quick links</h2> <p> PS5 preorders are opening up across the console's launch territories. Stock is low but keep an eye on the links below to secure your PS5...</p> <p> <strong> UK:</strong> </p> <strong> JD Williams</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live, new, new PS5 stock released periodically</strong> <strong> Very.co.uk</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live, new </strong> , <strong> new PS5 stock released periodically</strong> <strong> Amazon</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Game</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Smyths Toys</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Currys PC World</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Argos</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Box.co.uk</strong> <strong> – register your interest</strong> <strong> AO.com</strong> <strong> – back in stock soon</strong> <strong> Carphonewarehouse</strong> <strong> – register your interest</strong> <strong> CoolShop</strong> <strong>  – no consoles but plenty of P5 games and accessories</strong> <p> <strong> US:</strong> </p> <strong> Amazon</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live out of stock, register your interest</strong> <strong> Best Buy</strong> <strong> – pre-orders coming soon</strong> <strong> Target</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Walmart</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <strong> Gamestop</strong> <strong> – pre-orders live but currently unavailable</strong> <p> <strong> AU:</strong> </p> <strong> Amazon AU</strong> <strong> : both models now sold out </strong> <strong> Sony Store Australia</strong> <strong> : all gone, register for updates</strong> <strong> JB Hi-Fi</strong> <strong> : launch allocation sold out</strong> <strong> EB Games</strong> <strong> : pre-orders sold out</strong> <h2> PlayStation 5 release date</h2> <p> Sony has finally confirmed that the PS5 release date is 12th November in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, and 19th November in the UK and the rest of the world. </p> <p> This sets up a battle royale between the PS5 and new Xbox Series X in time for Christmas 2020 and the holiday season. Pre-coronavirus, Sony planned to reach sales of six millions units by March 2021. Then in early 2020,, the company said it had doubled PlayStation 5 production and was aiming to have 10 million units in circulation by that same March date now.</p> <p> But in September, sources told Bloomberg that Sony is struggling with production issues and has dropped its PS5 production estimate from 11 million units to 7 million. Could we see a PS5 shortage this Christmas? Apparently it all hangs on whether Sony can increase production of its system-on-chip – the tricky-to-make CPU that's said to be causing the snafu.     </p> <p> Games consoles themselves generally sell for very small, if any, profit, and Sony will be looking to the content and services to help recoup costs. The more PS5s the company has out there, the faster that can happen.</p> <strong> Xbox Series X price and pre-orders</strong> <strong> Best gaming headsets</strong> <h2> PlayStation 5 pre-orders and price</h2> <p> One of the biggest questions in tech - how much will the PS5 cost - has finally been answered. Sony has announced that the PS5 price will be £449 ($499, €499) while the PS5 Digital Edition of the console will go on sale for £359 ($399, €399) in November.</p> <p> PS5 pre-orders are now live. Most retailers sold out almost immediately but we've seen UK retailers JD Williams and Very releasing new PS5 stock periodically. You'll need to be quick, though, as it seems to sell out within minutes.</p> <p> In the US, Amazon has emailed some buyers to let them know they might not get their pre-ordered PS5s on the launch day. The good news is that Sony has promised more stock soon. Here's a handy guide to PS5 pre-ordering , including the best deals and tips that will increase your chances of securing a PS5.</p> <p> It was originally thought that Sony would announce the PS5 price and release date at a rumoured event on 9th September – 25 years to the day since the original PlayStation went on sale. Instead Sony instead announced the details at a Showcase event on 16th September. The 40-minute online event featured a look at some more games coming at launch, as well as the all-important release date and price information.</p> <p> Bloomberg analyst Masahiro Wakasugi was right to tip the PS5 Digital Edition to "dip below $400". He spot on about that, but he also claimed that Sony could undercut Microsoft by pricing the full PS5 at $450 – $50 less than the Xbox Series X. Sadly for PS5 fans, he was wrong on that score.</p> <p> Sony no doubt always had price in mind when it chose to take the two-console approach, offering a full-fat, disc-playing PS5 and a more affordable disc-less 'Digital Edition'. </p> <strong> PS5 vs PS5 Digital Edition</strong> <p> What seems more solid is the price of the games themselves and it looks like the new normal could be $70 (£65/$100 AUD) for PS5 games after games publisher 2K announced that its sports sim NBA 2K21 would cost just that. That's a $10 rise on the standard $60 game price. </p> <p> That $60 rate came in with the original Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 about 15 years ago, now, so perhaps this relatively small hike is well overdue and a lot more generous than it could have been.</p> <h2> PlayStation 5 design: what does the PS5 look like?</h2> <p> After months of rampant speculation, leaks and renders, we finally know what the PS5 looks like, and it's not as anyone predicted. To these eyes, it's better: the utilitarian looks of the Xbox Series X and Xbox One (and, to a lesser extent, the PS4) have been eschewed in favour of something altogether bolder, more sculpted and more sci-fi. It will almost certainly prove divisive and may age quickly, but we're impressed at first glance.</p> <p> Sony recently invited a select group of Japanese YouTubers to go hands-on with the PS5. Their first impressions? That the PS5 is big (39 x 26 x 14cm) but blessed with elegant curves. You watch one of the first PS5 hands-on videos here , courtesy of respected Japanese games publication Famitsu .</p> <p> So far, Sony has chosen to show the PS5 almost exclusively in its vertical orientation (it can also be positioned horizontally), where its white shell has the look of a high-collared catsuit with an opening that plunges down further than some might consider decent and creates a 'V' to denote that this is the fifth-generation PlayStation console.</p> <p> That high, wide collar is separated from the black body of the machine by finned gaps that are almost certainly designed to allow the hot air generated by the console's processing bits and pieces to escape. Rather than hide this functional part of the design, Sony has chosen to highlight it with some lovely blue lighting. This is form and function working as one. According to Japanese news outlet 4gamer, the cooling system is near-silent, so there shouldn't be too much whirring during long sessions. </p> <p> While official dimensions have not yet been revealed, a hard-working Redditor called GREBO7 has produced an image comparing the PS5 for size with every recent PlayStation and Xbox console. Spoiler alert: it's massive.</p> <p> For what it's worth, while the PS5 is much taller than the Xbox Series X (and every other console on the list, for that matter), it is also slimmer, even with the disc drive. The PlayStation 5 Digital Edition is slimmer still, and its slenderness and symmetry make it undeniably the better looking of the two consoles, with the standard version's disc drive looking a little awkward, particularly when they're stood side-by-side. You might even assume that the Digital Edition was designed first, with the disc drive reluctantly added afterwards.</p> <p> The design includes two slim slots or buttons (they could also be lights but neither was illuminated during the reveal) towards the bottom of the console's front, plus a standard (presumably 3.0-certified) USB socket and a USB-C further up. The rear of the machine has not yet been revealed, so the sockets it has back there remain a mystery for now.</p> <strong> VRR: everything you need to know about Variable Refresh Rate</strong> <p> Crucially, the final PS5 design is vastly different from that of the many leaks we've seen in the last few months. On 13th August, a patent was registered as a Sony electronic device and listed Sony technical director Yusuhiro Ootori as its designer. And below, thanks to LetsGoDigital, is a coloured in and graphically rendered version of the the black and white sketch that accompanied the patent.</p> <p> To call that wide of the mark would be an understatement: this huge, flying V console was almost certainly a developer machine, or a concept for one, and was probably never considered as the final design.</p> <h2> Here's the official PS5 logo</h2> <p> Sony started its CES 2020 press conference with a segment on the forthcoming PS5 and while no new specs were released or images shown, Sony did confirm the official PS5 logo. </p> <p> The design... won't shock you. It stays in line with previous PlayStation logos, keeping it simple with white lines on a black background.</p> <strong> Sony reveals the official PS5 logo (and it's familiar)</strong> <h2> Will the PlayStation 5 have a 4K Blu-ray drive?</h2> <p> Yes, the PS5 will play 4K Blu-rays . Cerny initially only confirmed the PS5 will have an optical disc drive, but we now have confirmation that the disc drive of the standard PlayStation 5 will indeed play 4K Blu-rays.</p> <p> It was disappointing that the PlayStation 4 didn't include a 4K Blu-ray drive, so we're glad to see Sony supporting the 4K disc format in the new console. Currently both the Xbox One S and X come with 4K disc drives which gives them extra appeal over the PS4 for home cinema enthusiasts. But the PS5 will bring the Ultra HD Blu-ray fight to Xbox.</p> <p> Of course, if you're not interested in playing 4K Blu-rays (or buying disc-based versions of games) you can go for the disc drive-less PlayStation 5 Digital Edition instead. We expect both consoles to feature video streaming apps such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ , although there's so far been no mention of these.</p> <strong> Best gaming TVs</strong> <h2> Will the PlayStation 5 support 8K video?</h2> <p> The PS5 will support 8K video, at least to an extent. The PlayStation 5 will ship with an AMD Ryzen chip — a 7nm chip on Zen 2 architecture — and a GPU from the Radeon Navi-family. It will also come with SSD storage. The promise from this trio of hardware is fast load times, large bandwidth capabilities and oodles of graphics grunt. </p> <p> Enough grunt for true, native 8K gaming? Almost certainly not, though it may be possible with simpler games when upscaling. We already know that Gran Turismo 7 , for example, will not be in 8K. The game's creator, Kazunori Yamauchi, said: "I think, display resolution-wise, 4K resolution is enough." </p> <p> It was for a time suggested by the likes of YouTuber Zenj Nishikawa that Sony would announce a PS5 Pro alongside a standard PS5, and that the Pro version would support, among other things, 8K video and higher frame rates. However, no PS5 Pro has so far been mentioned.</p> <p> With 8K TVs still far from mainstream, it seems that Sony is focussing on the fact that the selected PS5 games will support 4K gaming at 120Hz. They include: Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition, DIRT 5, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege. </p> <p> Of course, it's worth noting that you'll need a compatible TV to be able to enjoy the high frame rates and resolution potential of the PS5. While the current choice isn't as vast as you might think, many new TVs do support 4K/120fps over HDMI. (This resolution and frame rate pairing is actually a  HDMI 2.1  feature, although just because a TV supports HDMI 2.1 doesn't necessarily mean it supports 4K/120fps, and vice versa.) These compatible TVs include  LG's 2020 OLED TV range , most of  Samsung's 2020 QLED TVs . Sony has also recently launched a ' Ready for PlayStation 5 ' logo for its Bravia TVs to help make sure you're buying the right one.</p> <p> As for HDR, both the PS4 and PS4 Pro are already HDR -enabled, supporting the HDR10 format, and there’s no reason to believe that this would be any different for the PS5. Will we see a more advanced version of HDR, such as HDR10+ and Dolby Vision , also employed? We certainly wouldn't rule it out, particularly as Dolby has announced that the Xbox Series X will support Dolby Vision from 2021.</p> <p> While it's clear that the PS5 is exceptionally powerful, it's also going to have decent green credentials. The Head of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan, revealed a feature called "suspended gameplay" which gets through less power than the current console. If it was used by one million PS5 owners, that would represent a reduction in electricity consumption equivalent to 1000 US households.</p> <h2> PS5 audio: will the PS5 support Dolby Atmos?</h2> <p> It seems unlikely the PS5 will support Dolby Atmos, at least for games. Again, the current crop of Xbox One consoles already outstrips the PS4 in the audio department, certainly on paper, with Sony's consoles limited to 7.1 audio. Microsoft's machines, on the other hand, both come with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio for gaming and for 4K Blu-ray playback.</p> <p> PlayStation’s lead architect and console producer, Mark Cerny, has promised that the PS5 will herald a new ‘gold standard’ in audio, but it looks as though the company is delivering this using new, bespoke technology.</p> <p> At the end of the Sony's March 2020 PS5 update , Cerny left his audience with the distinct feeling that the PS5 would not be supporting Dolby Atmos. The PS5 will output native 3D audio using a newly-designed 'Tempest Engine' with Cerny stating that he wanted to include processing for far more than the 32 objects he claimed Dolby Atmos is limited to ( Dolby has since refuted that claim ).</p> <p> So how will PS5 3D audio be delivered? If you want to experience  3D audio  on the new  PS5 or PS5 Digital Edition, you'll need to invest in a pair of Pulse 3D headphones (£90/$99/€99).</p> <p> Itching to experience 3D Audio? A handful of top developers recently revealed how they're putting the tech to good use. According to Returnal director, Harry Krueger, "in a fast-paced action game with lots of verticality, [3D Audio] can help with the player’s situational awareness, and make it more intuitive for players to pinpoint the locations of nearby enemies".</p> <p> Meanwhile, Resident Evil Village producer Jun Takeuchi claims it's almost as if, "PS5 3D AudioTech was made specifically with horror games in mind". Takeuchi even claims that players will no longer have to invest in expensive surround sound set-ups: "Now, just putting on a headset, they can get a full 3D audio experience." We wouldn't be so sure of that, but it seems gaming headsets are going to get a serious upgrade.</p> <p> Could the PS5 also be compatible with Sony's own 360 Reality Audio format . It seems likely.</p> <p> But just because Sony is focused on its own 3D audio formats doesn't necessarily mean Atmos is definitely out. While there's been no news on that front, we wouldn't be surprised if the Dolby format is also supported, particularly for movies and TV shows. We also know that not every game will include Tempest audio, and perhaps these will utilise Dolby Atmos as a next best thing solution.</p> <p> We certainly hope it's not a case of Tempest or bust. Not everyone likes wearing headphones for games, and it seems highly unlikely that Sony's new format will be compatible with all of the home cinema kit already on the market and in peoples' homes. The last thing we all want to do is have to go out and buy new soundbars and AV receivers .</p> <h2> PlayStation 5: DualSense controller</h2> <p> With each new PlayStation comes a new DualShock controller, except this time it doesn't. Sony has gone to the next level and created the DualSense controller to partner the PS5. You can get a good look at the controller, including its LEDs, in this Japanese hands-on video .</p> <p> It's a sleek and modern-looking design with a two-tone finish instead of the standard single hue of the DualShocks. Sony has promised that the new controller "will captivate more of your senses as you interact with the virtual worlds in PS5 games. The features of DualSense, along with PS5’s Tempest 3D AudioTech, will deliver a new feeling of immersion to players."</p> <p> That added immersion is set to come across primarily through a more evolved sense of touch. Haptics have replaced the rumble technology to create a broader range of more realistic feedback. Players will now get more nuanced sensations such as the slow grittiness of driving a car through mud.</p> <p> The L2 and R2 trigger buttons feature adaptive, programmable resistance so that players can feel more or less tension through certain actions. If you're a PS4 user, it's worth noting that 'X' will be the PS5's confirmation button, rather than 'O'.</p> <p> DualSense is, of course, wireless. So far, there are no official details on how long you get from a single charge but Sony has stressed that it's tried to maintain a strong battery life. </p> <p> Leaked photos which appeared on Twitter in August suggest that the PS5's DualSense controller could have much larger capacity battery than the current PS4 DualShock controller (1,560mAh vs 1000mAh). </p> <p> That's a big jump in numbers but the PS5's controller contains a host of sophisticated technology which could soak up that increase in battery capacity. That said, our feeling is that battery technology has improved so much in the last few years that it would be a surprise if the PS5 controller didn't last longer than its predecessor.</p> <p> The controller features a built-in microphone array and speaker, which means players can chat to their friends without the need for a  gaming headset , and the 'Share' button has been replaced by a new 'Create' button. It's to "create epic gameplay content to share with the world" according to Sony. More details on what that entails are promised closer to launch.</p> <p> To fit these new components, the style and shape of the new controller has been tweaked. The angle of the hand triggers has been changed and the grip updated too The aim is to make the DualSense still feel light and small. The light bar has also shifted to the sides of the touchpad from its position on top of the DualShock 4, which is a rather pleasing aesthetic if nothing else.</p> <p> If, for whatever reason, you can't stand the thing, then the PlayStation 5 should be backwards compatible with the PS4 controller.</p> <h2> PlayStation 5: SSD storage</h2> <p> According to Cerny's March 2020 PS5 update, an internal SSD was the most requested feature by game developers and, as expected, that's exactly what the PS5 is confirmed to deliver. According to Cerny, compared to an HDD, it offers 100x faster load speeds which means no load screens, ultra fast streaming and ultra fast boot speeds too.</p> <p> In real terms, streaming is apparently so fast that a game can load all the graphics and textures behind an online player faster than the player can run around. In a recent hands-on demo, Japanese gamers reported that players could restart after dying in the "blink of an eye". </p> <p> As Brian Horton, creative director of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales , recently commented , the PS5's "near-instant" loading times will allow game developers to create ultra-detailed 4K scenes – without fear of keeping users waiting. </p> <p> Ari Arnbjörnsson, working on third-person sci-fi shooter Returnal , has even questioned the point of splitting PS5 games into levels: "What does it mean for developers when everything can be loaded from the disk that fast? Will we even need the concept of 'levels' anymore?” </p> <p> The PS5's SSD is a custom unit with a capacity of 825GB. That's big, but not absolutely huge, especially when you consider how much space next-gen games are likely to take up. Thankfully, you can expand the console's storage, although doing so is a little complicated.</p> <p> You can connect an external hard drive via USB, but it seems likely that such a drive won't be fast enough to handle PS5 games. In which case, there are a couple of potential uses for an external USB hard drive that we can think of: to store PS4 games, and as a backup for the PS5 games you aren't currently playing but don't want to delete. The latter use would negate the need to re-download a game from the internet, potentially making it much quicker to get back into the action.</p> <p> You can also expand the internal SSD storage. It's not yet clear whether doing so would involve replacing the existing 825GB SSD or adding an extra one, but we do know, thanks to Digital Foundry , that either way you are going to have to get a particularly fast, PlayStation-approved, PCIe 4.0-based drive - a standard SSD won't necessarily have the speed to play PS5 games.</p> <p> PlayStation is in the process of testing potentially compatible drives but, interestingly, Cerny says that none so far have hit Sony's minimum spec. They are expected to do so by the end of the year, and PlayStation will offer specific recommendations once the PS5 has launched, but these next-gen SSDs are likely to be very expensive for a while.</p> <p> At least we're talking about SSDs that are (or at least will become) of an industry standard and aren't bespoke for PlayStation: a patent that leaked on 5th November 2019 showed sketches of a mystery cartridge that many believed was an expandable SSD storage module for the PS5, but that appears now to not be the case. That's probably a good thing, as it means prices will be defined by the market as a whole and not by Sony.</p> <h2> PS5 accessories</h2> <p> As well as revealing the design of the PS5 console itself, Sony used its June PlayStation event to reveal a number of PS5 accessories.</p> <p> The most interesting of the bunch is undoubtedly the Pulse 3D headset, which we expect Sony to push as the primary way to enjoy the PS5's new 3D audio. In design terms, it doesn't look dissimilar to the current Platinum Wireless Headset , albeit with much more matte white on show. Given how good Sony's last couple of gaming headsets have been, we've got high hopes for this new model.</p> <p> Sony's also made a reassuringly big deal of its new Media Remote, which looks designed to make using the PS5 as a 4K Blu-ray player and video streamer all the more intuitive.</p> <p> We've also now seen the DualSense Charging Station (for docking and charging two controllers at once) and HD Camera, and yet more accessories will surely be announced closer to launch.</p> <p> We've also just started seeing third-party PS5 accessories arriving. The Audeze Penrose wireless gaming headsets have PS5 and Xbox Series X in mind. Both headsets feature the US firm's highly regarded 100mm planar magnetic drivers, in addition to a detachable 'broadcast quality' boom mic for chat and streaming. Audeze says the mic is capable of reducing an impressive 20dB of background noise, so you should be able to clearly hear fellow gamers sling insults at each other.</p> <p> One thing the PS5 won't have is a classic digital optical audio port (as seen on the PS4 and PS4 Pro ). That tallies with Microsoft's decision to drop the port on the Xbox Series X .</p> <p> While Sony hasn't officially confirmed the news, gaming headset manufacturer Astro let the cat out of the bag during a press briefing. The company also confirmed that it will offer an HDMI-to-optical splitter for the PS5, which should allow 4K passthrough for video without causing any additional lag.</p> <h2> Will the PS5 be PSVR compatible?</h2> <p> Most definitely. Comments from Mark Cerny point towards an even bigger VR push from Sony with the PS5. VR technology is set to be hard designed into the build of the GPU. He didn’t mention whether there would be a PlayStation VR2 headset launched to go with the PS5, though.</p> <p> Given PSVR is not as strong on resolution as other headsets such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive it could make sense to launch a suitably powerful and impressive next-generation headset with the new console.</p> <p> One interesting twist is Sony may be working on a 3D hologram accessory for the PS5 for multiplayer games. A light emitter with an eye tracker could project an image directly to the user's retina to give the impression of a hologram floating in mid-air. Exactly what images Sony has in mind is another thing but you may want to reconsider multiplayer gaming in your pants.</p> <h2> Which PlayStation 5 games have been announced?</h2> <p> After a huge amount of guess-work and speculation, we now have titles for the first raft of games that are coming to PS5 and how they'll look on the shelves. Here's the list of games confirmed during the June PS5 games event:</p> <p> Astro’s Playroom (Japan Studio)</p> <p> Demon’s Souls (Bluepoint Games / Japan Studio)</p> <p> Destruction All Stars (Lucid Games / XDEV)</p> <p> Gran Turismo 7 (Polyphony Digital)</p> <p> Horizon Forbidden West (Guerrilla Games)</p> <p> Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales (Insomniac Games)</p> <p> Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (Insomniac Games)</p> <p> Returnal (Housemarque / XDEV)</p> <p> Sackboy A Big Adventure (Sumo Digital / XDEV)</p> <p> Bugsnax (Young Horses)</p> <p> Deathloop (Bethesda)</p> <p> Ghostwire (Tokyo (Bethesda)</p> <p> Godfall (Gearbox Publishing / Counterplay Games)   </p> <p> Goodbye Volcano High (KO-OP)</p> <p> Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (Rockstar Games)</p> <p> Hitman 3 (IO Interactive)</p> <p> JETT : The Far Shore (Superbrothers)</p> <p> Kena: Bridge of the Spirits (Ember Lab)</p> <p> Little Devil Inside (Neostream Interactive)</p> <p> NBA 2K21 (2K, Visual Concepts)</p> <p> Oddworld Soulstorm (Oddworld Inhabitants™)</p> <p> Pragmata (Capcom)</p> <p> Project Athia (Square Enix/Luminous Productions)</p> <p> Resident Evil Village (Capcom)</p> <p> Solar Ash (Annapurna Interactive / Heart Machine)</p> <p> Stray (Annapurna / Blue Twelve Studio)</p> <p> Tribes of Midgard (Gearbox Publishing / Norsfell)</p> <p> The Pathless (Annapurna Interactive / Giant Squid)</p> <p> These games are all either exclusive to PS5 or will arrive on PS5 before any other console, but it's worth pointing out that the only one we know will launch on the same day as the console is Astro's Playroom , which will come bundled with the PS5.</p> <p> More PS5 hands-on gameplay has been confirmed for 4th October (via gamesradar ). A slew of Japanese YouTubers will go hands on with some of the top games. Sony hasn't confirmed the titles but expect it to include Spider Man: Miles Morales .</p> <p> We are also aware of plenty of other games that are on the way, including Assassin's Creed Valhalla , Cyberpunk 2077 , Outriders , The Lord of the Rings: Gollum , FIFA 21 ,   Madden 21 , Quantum Error , Cris Tales , Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One , Dustborn , Metal: Hellsinger , Chivalry 2 , Paradise Lost , Dirt 5 , WRC 9 , Chorus, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines , and Observer: System Redux, Bioshock, Battlefield 6, Call of Duty Warzone.   </p> <p> Gamesindustry.biz also reports that Ubisoft is planning to launch Watch Dogs Legion , Rainbow Six Quarantine and Gods & Monsters on PS5. It's also been reported that the orginal version of Metal Gear Solid is being remade and will be exclusive to the PS5.</p> <p> That's already enough to get our teeth into and we're expecting plenty more besides. There's even talk of a PS5-enhanced version of The Last of Us: Part 2 in development, and the still-far-off The Elder Scrolls 6 will almost certainly one day make it to the PlayStation 5.</p> <h2> PS5 games: will the PS5 be backwards compatible?</h2> <p> ‘Incredibly powerful’, that’s how Sony has described the backwards compatibility of the PS5, which is potentially good news for PS4 owners who don’t wish to upgrade just yet but still want to play online with their friends that do.</p> <p> The PS5's backwards compatibility will not cover every PS4 game but, in a blog post , PlayStation's Hideaki Nishino stated that "we believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000+ PS4 titles will be playable on PS5".</p> <p> It seems that games are being made backwards compatible on a title-by-title basis, with the upshot that PS4 games that do run on the PS5 will do so with "higher or more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions".</p> <p> Sony hasn't said whether the PlayStation 5 will support games from earlier Sony consoles than the PS4, but, according to Ubisoft , it won't. The French games studio recently posted a comment on its support site that claimed backwards compatibility would be enabled for "supported PlayStation 4 titles" but would "not be possible for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 or PlayStation games". By the time Eurogamer reported the developments, Ubisoft had deleted the comment.</p> <p> That said, online comments in response to this official blog post suggest that the PlayStation 5 will be able to act as an emulator for PS4, PS3, PS2 and even original PlayStation games, but there's been no official confirmation of this.</p> <p> It's also worth mentioning that Sony has told PlayStation 4 game developers that any new titles submitted for certification after 13th July must also be compatible with PlayStation 5.</p> <h2> PlayStation 5 gaming</h2> <p> It's believed Sony will increase its focus on the subscription-based PlayStation Now cloud gaming platform and its Remote Play feature too.</p> <p> Microsoft and Sony recently announced that they're working together on cloud computing technologies, which will almost certainly give a boost to PlayStation Now. To date, the platform has been incomplete as far as top gaming titles go and there have been issues with lag and disconnects.</p> <p> Sony also filed a patent back in 2014 for a service where PlayStation games on the platform could be streamed to user devices other than the console itself - something to rival the upcoming Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud platforms.</p> <p> Sony is looking to 5G technology to help out while gaming on the move with Remote Play. The service currently allows players to stream games from their consoles to other devices such as tablets, mobiles and the handheld PS Vita. However, this might be bundled in as part of an all-new online platform.</p> <p> Another interesting part of the connectivity proposal is that it could link players up to a voice assistant. Rumours are that Sony is working on a service which can provide in-game help including whereabouts of game objects as well as hints and tips. If applied with the proper contextual cues, it should be far more efficient than a separate internet search. "Ok, PlayStation. Give me the cheat codes!"</p> <p> As for 4K gaming, an anonymous tipster recently suggested that the PS5 might 'struggle' to run 4K games at 60fps. The same leaker also claimed that the PS5 could be saddled with 'fake' 4K games, featuring scenes that the console would have to upscale from a lower resolution to native 4K resolution.</p> <p> However, TeamKill Media, the game developer behind PS5 first-person shooter Quantum Error quickly shot down those rumours . The US-based outfit tweeted that the cosmic-horror corridor shooter is "currently running at 4K 65-70 FPS unoptimized" on PS5, before adding, "We will be hitting our goal of 4K 60FPS."</p> <p> <strong> MORE:</strong> </p> <p> <strong> PS5 reveal: 5 big questions left unanswered</strong> </p> <p> <strong> PS5 vs Xbox Series X: specs, power, features, pricing and controllers compared</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Xbox Series X: release date, specs and news for the new Xbox</strong> </p> <p> <strong> What is Google Stadia?
