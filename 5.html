If you buy a PS5 then you get access to all of them, day one, to download.

Can we just talk for a minute about how extraordinary this game truly was - so mysterious, so gothic, so THRILLING. I’ll never forget the feeling I got seeing those blue glowing eyes down the end of a corridor about ten seconds before getting absolutely ended by a blue-eye knight for the first time. The demo ends, fittingly, ten seconds into a boss fight.</p> <p> Updated at 9.44pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.35pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:35</span> </p> <p> Why am I seeing a Five Nights at Freddy’s game in a PlayStation 5 showcase in the year 2020!? This was unexpected. Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security breach is distinctly less lo-fi than the cult horror playground sensations from a few years ago.</p> <p> Updated at 9.40pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.34pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:34</span> </p> <p> Another quick look now at Oddworld Soulstorm, an unlikely new entry in the disconcerting series of expectation-defying platformers. </p> <p> Updated at 9.40pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.31pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:31</span> </p> <p> Ultimate early-00s emo demon-killing series Devil May Cry 5 is getting a special-edition PS5 re-release. That soundtrack. CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG KILL ALL THE DEMONS CHUG CHUG *solo*</p> <p> That’ll be available digitally at launch.</p> <p> Updated at 9.59pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.29pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:29</span> </p> <p> Arkane’s stylish shooter Deathloop features two assassins with supernatural powers caught in an endless time loop. I’d describe its aesthetic as 70s James Bond but in the future, or blaxploitation but sci-fi.</p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.25pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:25</span> </p> <p> Chris Redfield is in Resident Evil 8 (also known as Village). It looks frankly hideous and terrifying, with a small-town setting (think Resident Evil 4 revisited), which surely will delight horror fans.</p> <p> Updated at 9.34pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.20pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:20</span> </p> <p> Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War looks very much like a Call of Duty game in the next short demo. We’re scouting out an airfield through binoculars in search of an assassination target before witnessing a bunch of murder, replete with slow-motion sniper bullets and a bomb-detonating RC car. The multiplayer alpha is exclusive to PlayStation.</p> <p> Updated at 9.32pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.16pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:16</span> </p> <h2> Hogwarts Legacy announced</h2> <p> Avalanche’s long-rumoured Harry Potter game from Warner Bros is the next announcement: we FINALLY get to play as a Hogwarts student (AMAZING) during the Fantastic Beast period (lame) in the late 1800s. You can even get out of Hogwarts into what looks like some open-world exploration. I’m going full Millennial right now and bouncing about on the sofa: I finally get to go to Hogwarts at the age of 32. It’ll be out 2021.</p> <p> Updated at 9.23pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.11pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:11</span> </p> <p> An extended look now at Spider-Man: Miles Morales, whose events pick up a year after the events of the last game. The villain is a gender-swapped Tinkerer (dead ringer for Mass Effect’s Tali imo), it’s set in Harlem, and there is a new array of high-tech enemies. The demo takes us through a pretty spectacular rescue on a blown-apart bridge.</p> <p> Updated at 9.23pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 9.06pm <span> BST</span> <span> 21:06</span> </p> <h2> Final Fantasy XVI announced</h2> <p> Final Fantasy XVI is a PlayStation 5 exclusive! JRPG Game of Thrones vibes from the latest in Square-Enix’s long-running fantasy series. It has epic monsters in a medieval-esque setting, the plot appears to involve crystals, and the combat has a bit of a Devil May Cry look. Here’s the reveal trailer:</p> <p> Updated at 9.18pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 8.57pm <span> BST</span> <span> 20:57</span> </p> <p> I’d tell you what my dream announcements would be, but honestly my dream announcement was a Demon’s Souls remake and that’s already happened. The return of Parappa the Rapper in 4K!?</p> <p> Updated at 8.57pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 8.42pm <span> BST</span> <span> 20:42</span> </p> <p> Of course, since June, Microsoft has announced plenty more info about its rival console(s), the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X. The whole of Twitter has been arguing about whether or not the marketing is confusing - which, to me, is a fairly good indication that it IS confusing - but here’s the basic info:</p> <p> -The Xbox Series S is an entry-level version of the new Xbox that will cost £249. It has no disc drive and cannot play games in 4K.</p> <p> -The Xbox Series X will cost £449 and outputs in 4K, and has a disc drive</p> <p> It’s a super aggressive price point from Microsoft - and coupled with Xbox Game Pass, which offers access to every new game from Microsoft’s studios, every new EA game and hundreds more for just over £10 a month, it’s really turned some heads. Xbox is even offering interest-free payment plans that can get you into the next generation of consoles for £20.99 a month. That’s very attractive, and cheaper in real terms than a cutting-edge games console has ever been before.</p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 8.34pm <span> BST</span> <span> 20:34</span> </p> <p> Let’s quickly recap some of the games we’ve seen so far on this futuristic-looking black and white monolith of a console:</p> <p> -Spider-Man: Miles Morales, an updated and enhanced Spider-Man game</p> <p> -Horizon: Forbidden West, a sequel to Zero Dawn, the spectacular robo-dinosaur open-world adventure</p> <p> -Grand Theft Auto V, YET AGAIN</p> <p> -Gran Turismo 7, featuring the World’s Prettiest Cars</p> <p> -Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, a stupendously good-looking cartoonish romp</p> <p> -Returnal, a sci-fi thriller from Housemarque</p> <p> -Sackboy: A Big Adventure, a friendly platformer starring LittleBigPlanet’s mascot</p> <p> -Hitman 3, the puzzle game disguised as a game about murder</p> <p> -Bugsnax, the Internet’s favourite, a game that so far defies explanation</p> <p> -A REMAKE OF DEMON’S SOULS!!! (ahem)</p> <p> -And who could forget Stray, the cyberpunk game about cats?</p> <span> </span> Photograph: Annapurna Interactive <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> 8.16pm <span> BST</span> <span> 20:16</span> </p> <p> Keza MacDonald</p> <p> Welcome to the Guardian’s PlayStation 5 showcase liveblog! I’m Keza MacDonald, video games editor, here to parse and analyse whatever Sony shows tonight. That’ll certainly be a date and price for the new console, but we’re looking at a 40-minute livestream here, so that definitely will not be all. A few new games will be likely, and we’ll probably see more of the games announced at the showcase back in June.<br> </p> <p> Updated at 8.24pm BST </p> <span> </span> <span> Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Twitter</span> <span> Topics</span> PlayStation 5 Games <span> Share on Facebook</span> <span> </span> <span> Share on Twitter</span> <span> </span> <span> Share via Email</span> <span> </span> <span> Share on LinkedIn</span> <span> </span> <span> Share on Pinterest</span> <span> </span> <span> Share on WhatsApp</span> <span> </span> <span> Share on Messenger</span> <span> </span> <span> Reuse this content</span> <h2> View all comments </h2> Order by <span> </span> newest oldest recommendations Show <span> 25</span> 25 50 100 All Threads <span> </span> collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading? <span> </span> View more comments <h2> Most popular </h2> Books Music TV &amp; radio Art &amp; design Film Games Classical Stage News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Support The Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute <span> </span> Subscribe <span> </span> <span> Back to top</span> <span> <span> </span> </span> © 2020 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
