The regular version of the console will cost $499.99.</p> <p> Microsoft announced earlier this month that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S will go on sale Nov. 10 for $499 and $299, respectively . The Microsoft Series X is slightly more powerful than the Series S and includes a disc drive for installing games while the Xbox Series S is smaller and will need to download games from the internet. Microsoft&#x27;s system comes with an eight-core  AMD  Zen 2 processor — like the PS5 — but will have a better graphics card than Sony&#x27;s rival machine.</p> <p> Sony is using a strategy similar to Microsoft&#x27;s. It will release both a regular PS5 with a disc drive and a PS5 Digital Edition that can only download and stream games.</p> <p> Microsoft will offer a financing plan that allows customers to pay for either console over 24 months.The Xbox Series S costs $24.99 per month on that plan while the Xbox Series X will cost $34.99 per month. The plan includes access to a library of games users can download and play.</p> <p> Sony said the PS5 will launch in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea on Nov. 12 and the rest of the world on Nov. 19. Sony said the launch date for China is still under exploration and will be announced at a later date. </p> <p> — CNBC&#x27;s Ryan Browne contributed to this report. </p> <span> VIDEO</span> <span> 6:08</span> <span> 06:08</span> Sony and Microsoft waiting to see who blinks first on console pricing: Analyst Squawk Box Asia <p> <br/> <strong> Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.</strong> <strong>  </strong> </p> Related Tags Asia Economy Advanced Micro Devices Inc Microsoft Corp Social media Mobile Subscribe to CNBC PRO Licensing &amp; Reprints CNBC Councils Supply Chain Values CNBC on Peacock Advertise With Us Join the CNBC Panel Digital Products News Releases Closed Captioning Corrections About CNBC Internships Site Map Podcasts Ad Choices Careers Help Contact <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> News Tips</h4> <p> Got a confidential news tip?
